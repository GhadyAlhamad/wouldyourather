## Project overview
In the "Would You Rather?" Project, you'll build a web app that lets a user play the “Would You Rather?” game. The game goes like this: A user is asked a question in the form: “Would you rather [option A] or [option B] ?”. Answering "neither" or "both" is against the rules. In your app, users will be able to answer questions, see which questions they haven’t answered, see how other people have voted, post questions, and see the ranking of users on the leaderboard.

## Feature
- Signup new user
- Login existing user from the list
- Home Page: Show list of polls that categorized into two categories: Answered polls, Unanswered polls.
- For unanswered questions: the user can answer question by choosing the option, then the app shows statistics about the question.  
- For answered questions: the user can show the statistics about the question.  
- Ask new question by any user.
- Leaderboard for showing the best 3 users that have top score.
